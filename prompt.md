1. i have two modules combined to train a rl algorithm one updates based on if the grid under the current grid is same as current grid as output a transformation which could potentially make it match with the o/p and other if the whole selections of other grid in combination with this fits pattern so should i update the  first model using RL or supervised loss?
2. nope the we dont have the right transformation it should find that its own & sometimes the grid under it might not be the right grid for it , it needs to be moved 
3. so then working to together with this another  model where should i write the first models training loop?
4. what i want the code to do is to pick the object try to place in some position grid try to find the best place 
5. i am also thinking of applying transformation to each object before placing its selected by another model which only looks at the postion under  it and see if it matches o/p how do i write that?
