# ARC Prize 2025 â€“ Neuro-Symbolic Solver

This project is focused on solving tasks from the [ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus)](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC) using a combination of **symbolic algorithms**  and **neural models**, integrating them in a neuro-symbolic framework. The goal is to develop systems that generalize from few examples and mimic human-like reasoning.
