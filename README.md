# ARC Prize 2025 â€“ Neuro-Symbolic Solver

This project is focused on solving tasks from the [ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus)](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC) using a combination of **symbolic algorithms**  and **neural models**, integrating them in a neuro-symbolic framework. The goal is to develop systems that generalize from few examples and mimic human-like reasoning.

## architecture


 I use this in combination which with a `example_selector` which focus on which selects which example in the task to select based a bandit algorithm  (in which the example the score is improving )

 next it applies the architecture given below `n` no of times:
 ![Architecture](Architecture.jpg)

here liklihood predicts the object to focus on and the classifier focus on which dsl to apply
