# arc-prize

 ---

 this is the first algorithm i used to find solution to arc prize here i used search algorithms such as BFS , A* search to reach the target grid by apllying some transformtaions sequentallu on the grid the problem is that it takes on input target and try to aplly transformtaion hence large no of the dsl and need to the find order of apllyong henece increase the search soace but also the model fepend on how good the dsls are if the dsl is inefficent to define the pattern the model will fail
